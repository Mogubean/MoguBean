Hello, I'm @MoguBean, I commonly go by the nickname "Beandon". I self-taught myself Java when I was 13 years old when I took an interest in owning a Minecraft Server of my own.
I've made many memories on my old servers and after many years of practicing Java through private projects, I'm now taking on the challenge of creating a fully custom
Spigot-based Minecraft Server. I aim to make this server public, hopefully, before summer of 2022.
